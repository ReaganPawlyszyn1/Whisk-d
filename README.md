Interactive mobile app designed in a whack-a-mouse format. 

The game is set in the attic of an old house, where your cat lives! As time goes on, you catch mice living in the attic floor in order to recieve "chz btx", which are a form of currency that allow you to buy graphics for your cat, upgrade your home, and even find new locations with special varieties of mice!


## Starting List
While working on this app throughout the past few months, I came up with a list of go-to things I knew I needed to get done.
1. Connect my graphics to the game
   
   *set up a value system with the graphics, create a mouse class, create background with proper z values*

2. Create randomized lists
    *randomize the mouse position on the screen, randomize the mouse sprite that spawns, randomize the cat paw sprite used to catch mice*
    
3. Create a point system with the mice
    *give mice actual point values and add to the overall score when mouse is tapped*
    
## Where I am now
After finishing the items on the list above, I was finally able to sumbit my app for review at the App Store. Below are some elements of my app being put up for review
